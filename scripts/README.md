## Styling code and verifying style checks

The asytle tool can be used to apply much of the required code styling used in
the project and `checkpatch.sh` can be used to check that uncommitted changes
meet the coding style

Our [Style Guides](https://unifyfs.readthedocs.io/en/dev/style-guides.html)
have our complete documentation coding conventions.
