               BurstFS: A Distributed Burst Buffer File System - 0.1.1
===============================================================================

Node-local burst buffers are becoming an indispensable hardware
resource on large-scale supercomputers to buffer the bursty
I/O from scientific applications. However, there is a lack of
software support for burst buffers to be efficiently shared by
applications within a batch-submitted job and recycled across
different batch jobs. In addition, burst buffers need to cope with
a variety of challenging I/O patterns from data-intensive scientific
applications.

BurstFS is a user-level burst buffer file system that supports scalable 
and efficient aggregation of I/O bandwidth from burst buffers while
having the same life cycle as a batch-submitted job. It is layered 
on top of CRUISE, a scalable checkpointing/restart I/O library. 
While CRUISE is designed for N-N write/read, BurstFS compliments its 
functionality with the support for N-1 write/read. It efficiently 
accelerates scientific I/O based on scalable metadata 
indexing, co-located I/O delegation, and server-side read clustering and
pipelining.


Please note that the current implementation of BurstFS is not of production 
quality, and is for research purpose only. The current client-side interface is based on POSIX, including open, 
pwrite, lio_listio, pread, write, read, lseek, close and fsync. BurstFS is designed 
for batched write and read operations under a typical bursty I/O workload (e.g. checkpoint/restart); 
it is optimized for bursty write/read 
based on pwrite/lio_listio respectively. It is still an open research question on 
whether we should give BurstFS a comprehensive POSIX support, or provide a few POSIX 
APIs, but layer on top of them with other higher-level I/O functions. Below is the 
guide on how to install and use BurstFS client.

1. Prepare and run 'configure':

./prepare
./configure --prefix=`pwd`/install CFLAGS="-g -O0"

2. Build library

make clean
make
make install

3. Compile the test program
cd tests
chmod +rx ../cruise-config
cp Makefile.gcc Makefile
make

4. Run client program:
When running client program, be sure to launch the server 
program beforehand. The sample scripts (based on SLURM) for the client 
program is provided(runwclient.sh, runrclient.sh).
If you don't want to use interactive job, you can combine the 
client and server scripts into one job script.

5. How to use BurstFS client?
For all programs in the same job, before performing POSIX I/O operations, 
use burstfs_mount to mount the program under a given 
prefix, BurstFS will intercept the POSIX I/O functions under 
that prefix. Use unmount in the last program to exit to terminate the 
burstfs server. Below is the explanation of some configurable 
environment variables for BurstFS client:

CRUISE_CHUNK_MEM: the maximum amount of allocated shared memory to 
store the data.
CRUISE_USE_SPILLOVER: enable the spillover feature. If this feature 
is enabled, once the preallocated 
memory chunk is used up, the extra data are spilled to the node-local SSD.
BURSTFS_INDEX_BUF_SIZE: the size of shared memory buffer to store the indices 
of burstfs (The support for index spillover has not been provided). 
BURSTFS_ATTR_BUF_SIZE: the size of shared memory buffer to store the 
file attribute.
CRUISE_EXTERNAL_DATA_DIR: the external directory on SSD to store the spillover 
data.
CRUISE_EXTERNAL_META_DIR: the external directory  on SSD to store the spillover 
indices.
SHM_REQ_SIZE: size of the request shared memory (the client will put all 
its read requests in this buffer and notify its delegator to fetch its requested 
data). 
SHM_RECV_SIZE: size of the receive shared memory (the delegator will put 
the fetched data in this buffer).

6. Some future works for a production system include but are not limited to:
a. Provide the exception handling for the following scenarios:
--  When the index buffer is full, spill over to SSD (Todo in cruise-fixed.c).
--  When the number of read requests in lio_listio exceeds the threshhold (BURSTFS_MAX_READ_CNT), or 
the read requests in the shared read request buffer overflows, split the read requests into 
multiple transfers (Todo in cruise-sysio.c).
--  Handle the exception when only partial data are returned for read or the returned data are incorrect.

b. Finalize file attribute management for open and fsync
-- Avoid the conflict on file id. Current implementation generate files id based on 
hashcode of file name, conflict happens when two file names are hashed to the same file id.
-- Provide atomic update on file id. When a file is openned with O_CREAT, the client first 
checks if the file is created, then creates a file if it does not exist, or returns error 
if O_EXCL is set. These operations needs to be atomic.
-- During fsync, the final file size should be the largest size (typically in the checkpoint workload) 
among the metadata sent by all clients. 
current implementation takes the last file size received as the final file size for fsync, which may not be the 
correct one.

c. Define the high-level API or provide the comprehensive implementation of all the POSIX functions. 
Because BurstFS is specialized for bursty I/O workloads, using POSIX will heavily constrain its 
performance benefit. May consider layering on top of it with higher-level APIs for bursty workloads 
(e.g. MPI-IO/burst buffer-specific APIs).

e. Garbage collection
-- When to conduct garbage collection is undetermined. Recommend lazily performing garbage collection when 
DRAM and SSD usage reaches a high watermmark.
